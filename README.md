# TANet_smoke
Texture-aware network for smoke density estimation.

For training: modify the ```tools/smoke_ori.yaml``` file according to your request before running ```/tools/train_0205.py```.

For testing: run the file ```tools/test2.py```.

The updated models, metrics and other outputs are recorded in ```tools/run/smoke/backbone_name```, where the well-trained model ```(train_epoch_131.pth)``` and results demonstrated in our paper locate.


The original training data comes from the paper "A Wave-Shaped Deep Neural Network for Smoke Density Estimation (IEEE TIP 2020)" (i.e., W-Net), whose datasets and code are available [here](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yfn/index.html). However, we employ randomly synthesis strategy represented by the equation below rather than directly adopting the trainig set provided by W-Net while training our TANet. 

$\boldsymbol{I}(x,y) = \boldsymbol{S}(x,y)\alpha + \boldsymbol{B}(x,y)\alpha$

In the equation, $\boldsymbol{I}(x,y), \boldsymbol{S}(x,y) and \boldsymbol{B}(x,y)$ stand for image pixel, smoke pixel and background pixel at coordinate $(x,y)$. $\alpha$indicates the smoke density value at this point. The smoke and background set can be accessed through [smokeLink](https://mega.nz/file/o4dQlRID#ilTHUkMamK4kEkk8Zygz-jIFWQ1-G8MzCIluMkY1RW0) and [bgLink](https://mega.nz/file/BoFB0DTS#eoc16GDy6o02gqlA7XJOPfCSO7K1bClnr6918tBUtbc).
